# Iris Dataset Exploration and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization techniques using the famous Iris dataset. The analysis covers data loading, inspection, and creation of fundamental visualizations to understand dataset characteristics.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset**: Iris Flowers Dataset
- **Samples**: 150
- **Features**: 4 numerical attributes
- **Target**: 3 species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
- **Features**: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width
- **Features Details**:
  - sepal_length: Sepal length in cm
  - sepal_width: Sepal width in cm  
  - petal_length: Petal length in cm
  - petal_width: Petal width in cm
    
## Data Quality
- No missing values in the dataset
- Balanced classes (50 samples per species)
- Clean, well-structured data suitable for analysis

## Analysis Objectives
- Load and inspect dataset structure
- Create basic statistical summaries
- Generate fundamental visualizations:
  - Scatter plots for variable relationships
  - Histograms for data distribution
  - Box plots for outlier detection

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Data loading and inspection using pandas
- Basic data summarization techniques
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) fundamentals

## Skills
pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
●	Data loading and inspection using pandas 
●	Basic data summarization 
●	Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn 


## Key Visualizations
- **Scatter Plots:** Analyze relationships between different flower measurements
- **Histograms:** Examine distribution of individual features
- **Box Plots:** Detect outliers and understand value spreads

## Insights
- Clear separation between setosa and other species
- Petal measurements are better discriminators than sepal measurements
- Some overlap between versicolor and virginica species
- No missing values in the dataset

## Key Findings
**Species Characteristics**
- Setosa: Distinctly smaller petals, clearly separable
- Versicolor: Medium-sized flowers, some overlap with virginica
- Virginica: Largest flowers on average

**Measurement Insights**
- Petal measurements show better species separation than sepal measurements
- Strong correlation between petal length and petal width
- Some outliers detected in sepal width measurements
- Virginica shows the most variation in measurements
